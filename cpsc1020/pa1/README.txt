 *Problems Encountered*
 None that are truly worth sharing.
 The worst problem encountered was an array boundary error
 when using a specific variable counter where I did not
 initially increment the counter correctly.

 *Solving Encountered Problems*
 I used gdb to find the array values when the error occurred
 and then was able to deduce the problem immediately.

 *Thoughts on this Assignment*
 Overall I think it was a fairly simple assignment,
 but it served the purpose of practicing separating 
 programs into lots of smaller functions that can be called
 instead of writing one excessively long main function
 with a lot of repeated code.
 There are only 2 things I did not like about the assignment,
 and those are the fact that we used PPM images instead of bitmap
 images, because bitmap I thought were easier to work with, but 
 maybe thats just me.  The other thing is that I just hate the
 overall formatting rule that caps lines at 80 characters long.
 It's an arbitrary number, and although there must be a cap
 at some number, it doesn't need to be a hard cap at 80 as long as
 its not a systemic problem in one file that makes the file hard
 to read and makes the overall format look ugly.
